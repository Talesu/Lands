+ Changed: [Suggestion] Since the old pillage/invading section in wars.yml was a bit confusing it has been restructured with
better names and organized. You may need to re-configure this section if you want to change something.
# Invading means that the enemy is invading their opponent. Depending on the options "role-settings_list", "block-place_list" and "block-break_list"
# they will be able to do certain actions in these lands, like opening chests.
# If you want to limit what they're able to do, edit "role-settings_list", "block-place_list" and "block-break_list" in this section.
invading:
  # Limit when invading enemies are able to do certain actions (editable in the "flags" section below).
  restrictions:
    # Set a minimum amount of players of the defenders, which need to be online before the attackers can interact in the land.
    # This value is applied to the land that is currently being invaded. Not the whole team (collection of lands).
    # NOTE: If you want to allow pillages WHILE no defender is online, set this option to 0.
    # NOTE: This setting requires server reload / restart.
    min-players: 1
