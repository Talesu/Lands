+ Added: [Suggestion] Permission for land owners, to define the maximum amount of disconnected collections of claims
    lands.locations.<number>
    Example: lands.locations.10
    Description: Set the max. amount of disconnected collections of claims for the players owned lands. This will only take effect, if the option treat-as-new is disabled in config.yml. This permission allows players to claim collections of chunks that are disconnected from the original land, but the force-near option will still be enforced once the maximum amount is reached.
