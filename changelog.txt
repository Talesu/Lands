+ Added: basic-mode option in config.yml, which does disable all advanced features, except claiming and trusting players.
    # Enabling this option will disable all advanced features. Meaning that only the bare
    # minimum of features will be enabled. This option is meant for servers that want to
    # have a very simple setup and only want players to use the claiming and trusting players
    # feature of the plugin. Enabling this option will forcefully disable some features, that
    # can't be turned back on as long as basic-mode is enabled.
    # NOTE: This setting requires server reload / restart.
    basic-mode: false

+ Added: Don't register sub commands, if their features are disabled in config
+ Improved: Auto disabling items of features, if they're disabled in config.yml
