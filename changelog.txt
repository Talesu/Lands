This isn't a feature update. However, this update makes some necessary changes
under the hood that are required to provide maintainability and automation in
the feature.

If you install this update and use some of my other plugins, make sure to update them as well.

- Removed: API: Methods and classes from the API that were deprecated for years now.
+ Added: API: Disconnected API usage from actual implementation
    While the old "way" is still supported, it's recommended that 3rd party developers update
    in the future. If you have any plugin that uses this deprecated class or flags, you'll
    get an info in your console.
